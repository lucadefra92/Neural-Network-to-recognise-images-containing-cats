# Neural-Network-to-recognise-images-containing-cats
In this project a logistic regression classifier is built. The goal of the classifier is to recognise pictures of cats. The project is developed using NumPy. Keras or Tensorflow are not used, as the aim is to fully understand the basic maths and computations behind a neural network. The project is readapted from a completed assignment from the course 'Neural Netwokrs and Deep Learning' taken on Coursera.

The algorithm is based on the following architecture:
- Initializing parameters
- Calculating the cost function and its gradient
- Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent) 
- Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.
